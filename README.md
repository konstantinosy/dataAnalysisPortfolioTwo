# Documentation

## Prerequisites

* Windows 8.1 and above.

* FAT 32 or exFAT is unfortunately not supported. WAMP requires a disk or a formatted NTFS partition.

* Certain Visual C++ packages need to be up to date, and such further information is found in the Further Resources part.

## Installation 

* Install by downloading the latest full WAMP server installer from the official website found below.

* Note that if running 64-bit Windows, installation of both 32 and 64 bit versions is needed. 

* Administrative rights are needed in order to install the server properly. Ensure by right clicking and running the installer with appropriate grants.


## Getting Started

* After installation of WAMP server launch phpMyAdmin via the taskbar icon.

* The default username is `root` without a password.

* Create a new database and name it as you find fit.

* Select the `Import` tab in order to import the downloaded [database](https://github.com/konstantinosy/dataAnalysisPortfolioTwo/blob/main/Database.sql) found from the repository.
